K-Nearest Neighbors Program
===========================


By Griffin Olson-Allen <griffino@umich.edu>

This program implements the k-nearest neighbors algorithm from scratch. It uses the Iris flower
data set, splitting the set into training and testing data. 70% of the data is used for training
and 30% is used for testing. The testing data is randomly selected from the training data, 
removed and then shuffled.
